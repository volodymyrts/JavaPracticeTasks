1) What is the difference between List and ArrayList?

- List is a child interface of a Collection interface, which is the root interface in collection hierarchy.
- List is the ordered collection of objects where duplicated values can be stored.
- List allows positional access and insertion of elements.
- Instance of List can be created by implementing various classes, but we can't create an instance of List.

- List is interface and ArrayList is a Class that implements List interface. (List interface is implemented
  by the classes of ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector and Stack.)
- ArrayList is a part of collection framework and is present in java.util package.
- It provides us with dynamic arrays in Java. Similar to a List, the size of the ArrayList is increased
  automatically if the collection grows or shrinks if the objects are removed from the collection.
- ArrayList allows us to randomly access the list.
- ArrayList can not be used for primitive types, like int, char, etc. We need a wrapper class for such cases.
